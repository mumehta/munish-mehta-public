<h1 id="devops-interview-questions">Devops Interview Questions<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#devops-interview-questions"></a></h1><h2 id="1-why-do-you-think-more-and-more-companies-are-embracing-devops">1. Why do you think more and more companies are embracing &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo;?<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#1-why-do-you-think-more-and-more-companies-are-embracing-devops"></a></h2><h3 id="answer">Answer<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#answer"></a></h3><p>There are several reasons why more and more companies are embracing DevOps practices. Here are a few key factors that contribute to the growing adoption of DevOps:</p>
<h4 id="1-faster-time-to-market">1. Faster Time to Market<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#1-faster-time-to-market"></a></h4><p>In today&rsquo;s highly competitive business landscape, speed is crucial. DevOps enables organisations to release software faster and more frequently by breaking down silos between development and operations teams. By automating processes, leveraging continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and adopting agile methodologies, companies can deliver new features and updates to customers quickly, gaining a competitive edge.</p>
<h4 id="2-improved-collaboration-and-communication">2. Improved Collaboration and Communication<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#2-improved-collaboration-and-communication"></a></h4><p>DevOps emphasises collaboration and communication between development, operations, and other teams involved in the software delivery life cycle. By breaking down barriers and fostering a culture of collaboration, companies can streamline processes, resolve issues faster, and achieve shared goals more effectively. This collaborative approach leads to better alignment of business objectives and enhanced teamwork across departments.</p>
<h4 id="3-enhanced-stability-and-reliability">3. Enhanced Stability and Reliability<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#3-enhanced-stability-and-reliability"></a></h4><p>DevOps practices focus on automation, infrastructure as code, and continuous monitoring, which contribute to greater stability and reliability of software systems. By automating the deployment and infrastructure provisioning processes, companies can minimize human error and reduce the risk of system failures. Additionally, continuous monitoring and proactive incident response enable organizations to detect and address issues before they impact users, ensuring high availability and improved customer satisfaction.</p>
<h4 id="4-scalability-and-flexibility">4. Scalability and Flexibility<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#4-scalability-and-flexibility"></a></h4><p>DevOps promotes the use of cloud infrastructure and containerization technologies, which provide scalability and flexibility to meet changing business demands. By leveraging cloud platforms and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, companies can dynamically scale their applications based on workload requirements, optimize resource utilization, and respond quickly to spikes in user traffic.</p>
<h4 id="5-continuous-feedback-and-improvement">5. Continuous Feedback and Improvement<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#5-continuous-feedback-and-improvement"></a></h4><p>DevOps encourages a feedback-driven culture, where teams regularly gather feedback from stakeholders and end-users. This feedback loop helps identify areas for improvement, refine processes, and enhance product features based on real-world usage. By continuously iterating and incorporating feedback, companies can deliver products that better align with customer needs, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
<h4 id="6-cost-efficiency">6. Cost Efficiency<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#6-cost-efficiency"></a></h4><p>DevOps practices enable companies to optimise resource utilisation, automate repetitive tasks, and reduce manual efforts, resulting in cost savings. By embracing infrastructure automation, companies can provision resources on-demand, reducing infrastructure costs and eliminating over-provisioning. Automation also allows teams to focus on high-value activities, improving efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>These factors collectively contribute to the growing adoption of DevOps as organisations strive for faster, more reliable software delivery, increased collaboration, and better alignment between business and IT operations.</p>
<h2 id="2-describe-any-vcs-branching-strategies-that-you-have-used">2. Describe any VCS branching strategies that you have used.<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#2-describe-any-vcs-branching-strategies-that-you-have-used"></a></h2><h3 id="answer-1">Answer<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#answer-1"></a></h3><p>There are several popular version control system (VCS) branching strategies that I have experience with. Here are a few commonly used ones:</p>
<h4 id="1-feature-branching">1. Feature Branching<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#1-feature-branching"></a></h4><p>In this strategy, each new feature or task is developed in a dedicated branch separate from the main development branch (often called the &ldquo;master&rdquo; or &ldquo;main&rdquo; branch). Developers work on their respective feature branches, making changes and committing code. Once the feature is complete, it is merged back into the main branch. This strategy allows for parallel development of multiple features, isolating changes and reducing conflicts.</p>
<h4 id="2-release-branching">2. Release Branching<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#2-release-branching"></a></h4><p>In this strategy, a separate branch is created for preparing a release. Once the development of new features for a particular release is complete, a release branch is created from the main branch. This branch is used for bug fixes, testing, and stabilization. When the release is deemed ready, it is merged into both the main branch and a long-term support branch if necessary.</p>
<h4 id="3-gitflow">3. GitFlow<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#3-gitflow"></a></h4><p>GitFlow is a branching model that provides a structured approach to software development. It uses two main branches: &ldquo;develop&rdquo; and &ldquo;master.&rdquo; The &ldquo;develop&rdquo; branch is used for ongoing development, while the &ldquo;master&rdquo; branch represents the production-ready code. Feature branches are created from the &ldquo;develop&rdquo; branch, and once completed, they are merged back into it. When it&rsquo;s time for a release, a release branch is created from the &ldquo;develop&rdquo; branch, and bug fixes or hotfixes are applied there. Once the release is stable, it is merged into both the &ldquo;master&rdquo; and &ldquo;develop&rdquo; branches.</p>
<h4 id="4-trunk-based-development">4. Trunk-Based Development<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#4-trunk-based-development"></a></h4><p>In this strategy, there is a single main branch (often called the &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; or &ldquo;main&rdquo; branch). Developers work directly on this branch, committing their changes frequently. Feature development and bug fixes are handled through small, incremental commits. Continuous integration and automated tests play a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the trunk branch.</p>
<h4 id="5-forking-workflow">5. Forking Workflow<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#5-forking-workflow"></a></h4><p>This strategy is often used in open-source projects. Instead of creating branches within a single repository, each developer creates a complete copy or &ldquo;fork&rdquo; of the main repository. They work on their forked repository, making changes and committing code. When they are ready to contribute their changes back to the main repository, they submit a pull request, which undergoes review and integration.</p>
<h2 id="3-which-vcs-tool-are-you-most-comfortable-with">3. Which VCS tool are you most comfortable with?<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#3-which-vcs-tool-are-you-most-comfortable-with"></a></h2><p>There are multiple VCS tools such as Git, Subversion - SVN, Mercurial, Perforce, Team Foundation Version Control - TFVC, Bitbucket to name a few. I am most comfortable with Git and Bitbucket.</p>
<h2 id="4-using-git-describe-how-you-would-squash-the-last-n-commits-into-a-single-commit-preserving-any-commit-messages">4. Using Git, describe how you would squash the last N commits into a single commit, preserving any commit messages.<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#4-using-git-describe-how-you-would-squash-the-last-n-commits-into-a-single-commit-preserving-any-commit-messages"></a></h2><h3 id="answer-2">Answer<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#answer-2"></a></h3><p>To squash the last N commits into a single commit while preserving the commit messages using Git, following should be done:</p>
<h4 id="1-be-on-correct-branch">1. Be on correct branch<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#1-be-on-correct-branch"></a></h4><p>Ensure you are on the branch where you want to squash the commits. You can use the <code>git branch</code> command to check your current branch and switch to the desired branch using <code>git checkout &lt;branch_name&gt;</code> if needed.</p>
<h4 id="2-find-commits-you-want-to-squash">2. Find commits you want to squash<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#2-find-commits-you-want-to-squash"></a></h4><p>Find the commits and determine how many you want to squash</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">1</span><span>git log
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="3-rebase-interactively">3. Rebase interactively<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#3-rebase-interactively"></a></h4><p>Run the following command to initiate an interactive rebase:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">1</span><span>git rebase -i HEAD~N
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Replace <code>N</code> with the number of commits you want to squash, starting from the most recent commit. For example, if you want to squash the last 3 commits, use <code>git rebase -i HEAD~3</code>.</p>
<h4 id="4-squash-commits">4. Squash commits<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#4-squash-commits"></a></h4><p>The interactive rebase will open a text editor with a list of commits. Each commit will be prefixed with the keyword &ldquo;pick.&rdquo; To squash commits, change the keyword from &ldquo;pick&rdquo; to &ldquo;squash&rdquo; (or just &ldquo;s&rdquo;). Ensure that the commit you want to keep the commit message for is marked as &ldquo;pick&rdquo; or &ldquo;edit&rdquo; in the rebase file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">1</span><span>pick c0ffee1 Commit message 1
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">2</span><span>squash abcdef2 Commit message 2
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">3</span><span>squash 1234567 Commit message 3
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="4-save-changes">4. Save changes<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#4-save-changes"></a></h4><p>Save and close the rebase file to proceed.</p>
<h4 id="5-squashed-commit-message">5. Squashed commit message<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#5-squashed-commit-message"></a></h4><p>Another text editor will open, allowing you to modify the commit messages for the squashed commits. By default, it will concatenate the commit messages together. You can edit the commit messages as needed. Save and close the file when you are done.</p>
<h4 id="6-sqush">6. Sqush<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#6-sqush"></a></h4><p>Git will perform the squash operation and create a new squashed commit. If you encounter any merge conflicts during the rebase process, resolve them following the prompts provided by Git.</p>
<h4 id="7-check-results">7. Check results<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#7-check-results"></a></h4><p>After the rebase is complete, the last N commits will be combined into a single commit with the updated commit message.</p>
<h4 id="8-force-push-to-remote">8. (force) Push to remote<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#8-force-push-to-remote"></a></h4><p>You may need to force push the branch to update the remote repository if you have previously pushed the original commits. Use the command <code>git push --force</code> to update the branch on the remote repository. However, exercise caution when force pushing, as it can potentially overwrite others&rsquo; work if they have already pulled the previous commits.</p>
<p>Note: Squashing commits alters the commit history, so it&rsquo;s generally recommended for use on local branches or branches that haven&rsquo;t been shared with others yet. If you&rsquo;re working on a shared branch, make sure to communicate and coordinate with your team before squashing commits to avoid conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="5-explain-the-difference-between-ci-and-cd">5. Explain the difference between CI and CD.<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#5-explain-the-difference-between-ci-and-cd"></a></h2><h3 id="answer-3">Answer<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#answer-3"></a></h3><p><strong>CI (Continuous Integration)</strong> and <strong>CD (Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment)</strong> are two related concepts in the software development and release process. Terms are often used together, however represent distinct stages in the software delivery pipeline.</p>
<h4 id="continuous-integration-ci">Continuous Integration (CI)<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#continuous-integration-ci"></a></h4><p>CI is a development practice that focuses on regularly integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. The primary goal of CI is to identify and address integration issues early in the development cycle. It involves automating the build and testing process, ensuring that each code change is built, tested, and validated in an isolated environment.</p>
<p>Key aspects of CI include:</p>
<h5 id="1-code-repository">1. Code Repository<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#1-code-repository"></a></h5><p>Developers commit their changes to a shared code repository, usually multiple times a day.</p>
<h5 id="2-automated-build">2. Automated Build<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#2-automated-build"></a></h5><p>When changes are committed, an automated build process is triggered to compile the code and generate executable artifacts.</p>
<h5 id="3-automated-testing">3. Automated Testing<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#3-automated-testing"></a></h5><p>After the build process, automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and sometimes even automated UI tests, are executed to verify the correctness of the code.</p>
<h5 id="4-early-feedback">4. Early Feedback<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#4-early-feedback"></a></h5><p>CI provides fast feedback to developers about the quality and integration of their code changes. If any issues arise during the CI process, developers are notified immediately so they can fix the problems quickly.</p>
<p>CI helps maintain a reliable and consistent codebase, reduces integration problems, and promotes collaboration among developers. It sets the foundation for CD by ensuring that code changes can be reliably and consistently built and tested.</p>
<h4 id="continuous-delivery-cd">Continuous Delivery (CD)<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#continuous-delivery-cd"></a></h4><p>CD extends CI by automating the release and deployment process, enabling frequent and reliable software releases. It focuses on the efficient and automated delivery of tested and validated code to production or other target environments.</p>
<p>Key aspects of CD include:</p>
<h5 id="1-automated-deployment">1. Automated Deployment<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#1-automated-deployment"></a></h5><p>After the CI process is successfully completed, CD automates the deployment of the application to the target environment. This involves packaging the application, configuring the required infrastructure, and deploying the code in a consistent and repeatable manner.</p>
<h5 id="2-release-management">2. Release Management<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#2-release-management"></a></h5><p>CD involves managing different versions and releases of the software, including versioning, tracking dependencies, and managing configuration changes.</p>

<h4 id="1-drop-rule">1. DROP Rule<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#1-drop-rule"></a></h4><ul>
<li>If a DROP rule is configured for a port in iptables, it silently drops or discards the incoming network packets without sending any response back to the sender.</li>
<li>When you try to connect to a port with a DROP rule, your connection attempts appear to time out or hang indefinitely.</li>
<li>From the perspective of the client, it appears as if the port is closed or unreachable, giving no indication of whether the port exists or not. The client keeps waiting for a response that never arrives.</li>
<li>The advantage of using DROP is that it provides a stealthier approach, making it harder for potential attackers to detect the presence of the protected port. However, legitimate users may experience longer connection timeouts or delays.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-reject-rule">2. REJECT Rule<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#2-reject-rule"></a></h4><ul>
<li>If a REJECT rule is configured for a port in iptables, it actively rejects incoming network packets and sends an appropriate response back to the sender.</li>
<li>When you try to connect to a port with a REJECT rule, your connection attempts receive an immediate rejection response indicating that the port is inaccessible or not allowed.</li>
<li>From the perspective of the client, it receives a clear indication that the port is closed or restricted, allowing the client to take appropriate action based on the rejection response.</li>
<li>The advantage of using REJECT is that it provides immediate feedback to the client, saving connection establishment time and reducing potential waiting and timeout issues. It also provides transparency by informing the client about the port status.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a DROP rule silently drops packets without any response, leading to longer connection timeouts or delays. On the other hand, a REJECT rule actively rejects packets and provides an immediate response, informing the client that the port is closed or inaccessible. The choice between DROP and REJECT depends on the desired level of visibility and whether you want to be stealthy (DROP) or transparent (REJECT) in terms of indicating the status of protected ports.</p>

<h2 id="14-how-would-you-prepare-for-a-migration-of-a-sql-database-from-a-hosted-data-centre-to-the-cloud">14. How would you prepare for a migration of a SQL database from a hosted data centre to the cloud?<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#14-how-would-you-prepare-for-a-migration-of-a-sql-database-from-a-hosted-data-centre-to-the-cloud"></a></h2><h3 id="answer-12">Answer<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#answer-12"></a></h3><p>Preparing for a migration of a SQL database from a hosted data center to the cloud involves careful planning and execution to ensure a smooth transition. Following are some key steps to consider:</p>
<h4 id="1-assess-the-database">1. Assess the Database<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#1-assess-the-database"></a></h4><p>Start by understanding the current database environment in the hosted data center. Evaluate the database size, schema, dependencies, performance requirements, and any specific configurations or customizations.</p>
<h4 id="2-choose-the-cloud-provider">2. Choose the Cloud Provider<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#2-choose-the-cloud-provider"></a></h4><p>Select a cloud provider that best suits your requirements. Consider factors like performance, scalability, security, availability, pricing, and compatibility with your SQL database.</p>
<h4 id="3-design-the-cloud-infrastructure">3. Design the Cloud Infrastructure<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#3-design-the-cloud-infrastructure"></a></h4><p>Plan the cloud infrastructure to host the SQL database. Decide whether to use managed database services like Azure SQL Database or AWS RDS, or set up a virtual machine (VM) running SQL Server in the cloud. Determine the appropriate instance size, storage capacity, and networking configuration.</p>
<h4 id="4-data-migration-strategy">4. Data Migration Strategy<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#4-data-migration-strategy"></a></h4><p>Define the strategy for migrating the database. Options include:</p>
<h5 id="a-database-backup-and-restore">a. Database Backup and Restore<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#a-database-backup-and-restore"></a></h5><p>Take a backup of the database from the hosted data center and restore it in the cloud. This approach is suitable for smaller databases with minimal downtime requirements.</p>
<h5 id="b-database-replication">b. Database Replication<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#b-database-replication"></a></h5><p>Set up replication between the hosted database and the cloud database to keep them synchronized. Once the replication is caught up, switch the application to use the cloud database.</p>
<h5 id="c-data-pumping-or-etl-tools">c. Data Pumping or ETL Tools<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#c-data-pumping-or-etl-tools"></a></h5><p>Use data pumping or Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tools to transfer the data from the hosted database to the cloud database. This method is suitable for large databases or complex migration scenarios.</p>
<h4 id="5-plan-for-downtime-and-data-synchronization">5. Plan for Downtime and Data Synchronization<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#5-plan-for-downtime-and-data-synchronization"></a></h4><p>Determine the downtime tolerance and plan for minimizing the impact. Consider the time required to transfer data, test the application, and synchronize any data changes made during the migration process.</p>
<h4 id="6-test-and-validate">6. Test and Validate<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#6-test-and-validate"></a></h4><p>Set up a testing environment in the cloud to validate the migration process. Perform thorough testing to ensure data integrity, application functionality, and performance meet expectations.</p>
<h4 id="7-application-configuration">7. Application Configuration<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#7-application-configuration"></a></h4><p>Update the application configuration to point to the new cloud database. This may involve modifying connection strings, credentials, and other relevant settings.</p>
<h4 id="8-security-and-compliance">8. Security and Compliance<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#8-security-and-compliance"></a></h4><p>Review and implement security measures and compliance requirements for the cloud environment. Configure appropriate firewall rules, access controls, encryption, and auditing mechanisms to ensure data protection and compliance.</p>
<h4 id="9-monitor-and-optimize">9. Monitor and Optimize<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#9-monitor-and-optimize"></a></h4><p>Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms in the cloud environment to track the performance, availability, and resource utilization of the SQL database. Continuously monitor and optimize the cloud infrastructure as needed.</p>
<h4 id="10-backup-and-disaster-recovery">10. Backup and Disaster Recovery<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#10-backup-and-disaster-recovery"></a></h4><p>Establish a backup strategy and implement disaster recovery measures for the cloud-based SQL database. Configure regular backups and test the restore process to ensure data recoverability.</p>
<h4 id="11-plan-for-cutover-and-rollback">11. Plan for Cutover and Rollback<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#11-plan-for-cutover-and-rollback"></a></h4><p>Define a cutover plan that includes a rollback strategy in case any issues arise during the migration. Document the steps involved in switching the production environment to the cloud database, ensuring minimal disruption.</p>
<h4 id="12-execute-the-migration">12. Execute the Migration<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#12-execute-the-migration"></a></h4><p>Execute the migration plan during a scheduled maintenance window or a time that minimizes impact on users. Follow the defined steps, monitor the migration progress, and address any issues promptly.</p>
<h4 id="13-post-migration-validation">13. Post-Migration Validation<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#13-post-migration-validation"></a></h4><p>Perform post-migration validation to ensure the database is functioning correctly in the cloud environment. Conduct additional testing and monitoring to verify performance, data integrity, and application functionality.</p>
<p>It is important to involve relevant stakeholders, communicate the migration plan to the team, and have contingency plans in place. Each migration scenario may have unique requirements, so it&rsquo;s essential to adapt the above steps to your specific situation and seek guidance from cloud provider documentation and best practices.</p>
