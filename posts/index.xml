      <description>Confused and Puzzeled how and where to get started?
No, you are not alone. It is totally natural to get overwhalmed with so many services offered by AWS. Here, i aim to provide just enough information to get started. AWS, or Amazon Web Services does not need any introduction. It is market leader and 80% of cloud workload is on AWS.
Sometime, i wonder there should be a guide of simple steps that should guide me just enough to get started with my AWS account.</description>
